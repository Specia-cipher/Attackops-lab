## 🎯 Overview

AttackOps-Lab is a collection of offensive security tools designed for:

✅ Simulating real-world attack chains.
✅ Understanding adversarial techniques in a controlled environment.
✅ Building offensive tools that mirror MITRE ATT&CK and Lockheed Cyber Kill Chain stages.
✅ Equipping defensive security teams to recognize and counter these attacks.

**This project is intentionally designed to complement DefenseOps-Lab, showcasing a comprehensive understanding of both offensive and defensive security principles.** It is being built with flexibility in mind, **leveraging the resources of both a laptop (during periods of stable power) and a mobile environment (Kali Linux via UserLAnd on phone and Termux) for various stages of development and testing.**

## 🚀 Project Objectives

1.  🎯 Hands-on mastery of offensive security techniques
2.  🏹 Build a library of modular tools covering Reconnaissance to Impact.
3.  🛡️ Provide red-teamers and blue-teamers with a controlled sandbox for practicing attack and defense.
4.  🐳 Offer containerized deployments for isolated, reproducible environments (primarily on laptop).

## ⚙️ Laptop-Focused Tools & Modules

| Stage          | Tool Name        | Description                                                                                                                                                                 | Status                         |
|----------------|------------------|-----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------|--------------------------------|
| Reconnaissance | 🕵️ ReconRaptor      | Performs active reconnaissance against targets, including port scanning, OS detection, service version detection, and subdomain enumeration.                                | ✅ Ready to use                |
| Weaponization  | 💣 PayloadForge     | Generates basic Python reverse shells with command execution, Linux persistence (via cron job), and file download capabilities. Requires a separate listener script (`listener.py`) to handle connections. | ✅ Initial functionality complete |
| Command & Control| 🎛️ C2Ghost         | Simulated C2 server for managing reverse shells.                                                                                                                      | [Initial plan: Basic listener] |

## 🐳 Containerization

This lab will aim for Docker support, primarily developed and tested on the laptop:

* 🐳 Each module containerized for isolation.
* 📦 Docker Compose for spinning up the full attack chain.
* 📱 Lighter modules might explore Termux-compatible packaging in the future.

---

## 📦 Deployment

1.  Clone the repo:

    ```bash
    git clone [https://github.com/Specia-cipher/AttackOps-Lab.git](https://github.com/Specia-cipher/AttackOps-Lab.git)
    cd AttackOps-Lab
    ```

2.  Run modules (check the comments in the scripts for environment suitability - laptop or phone):

    ```bash
    # Example (Laptop):
    python3 recon_raptor.py google.com
    python3 payloadforge.py

    # Example (Phone - via Termux/UserLAnd):
    python3 phish_craft.py --template basic_email.html --target victim@example.com
    ```

3.  Deploy full lab in Docker (Laptop):

    ```bash
    docker-compose up --build
    ```
